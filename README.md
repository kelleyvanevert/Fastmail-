# Fastmail+

As my style of email management greatly relies on Fastmail's pin-functionality,
 and because Fastmail doesn't provide any labelling system (their folder system just
 doesn't suit me for this purpose) â€” I decided to ease my cognitive email-organisational
 load by just patching a locally-stored labelling system into the UI with a small
 Chrome extension.

**To use it,** just download the repo, and load it as an unpacked extension.
